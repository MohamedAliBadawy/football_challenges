## Gameplay 
Select your leagues and a starting club to kick off the game.

The game begins with a designated starting club.

The first player must input a player who has played for the starting club.

 The player can either input a correct player or lie and input a wrong player.

 The next player has two choices:
 - Call Out a Cheat: If they believe the previous player lied, they can call them out. If the accusation is correct, the accusing player earns a point. If the accusation is wrong, the accused player gets the point.
- Continue the Game: If they don't want to call out a cheat, they can continue the game by inputting a club that the previous player has played for.
